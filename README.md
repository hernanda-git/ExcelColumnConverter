# ExcelColumnConverter

The `ExcelColumnConverter` repository contains a C# class file that provides a method for converting a column number to its corresponding Excel column name. 

## Method

The `GetExcelColumnName` method takes an integer column number as input and returns the corresponding column name as a string. This utility can be useful when working with Excel files programmatically, allowing you to convert between numeric column indices and their alphabetical representations.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `GetExcelColumnName` method:

```csharp
ExcelColumnConverter converter = new ExcelColumnConverter();

int columnNumber = 27;
string columnName = converter.GetExcelColumnName(columnNumber);
Console.WriteLine("Column number " + columnNumber + " corresponds to Excel column " + columnName);
```
